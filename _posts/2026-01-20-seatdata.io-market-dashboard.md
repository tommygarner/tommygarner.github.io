## Abstract
When reporting data, stakeholders care less about individual rows of data and more about **quickly understanding the value** across categories, venues, and cities. This post walks through how I took my SeatData.io snapshots from BigQuery into Tableau to build an **interactive market dashboard that uses StubHub resale as a proxy**. The end result is a tool that lets a pricing or partnership analyst **drill down** from state, venue and event to answer practical questions.

## Key Contributions

-  Linked Tableau dashboard wired to SeatData.io snapshots
-  7-day market valuation view by category, venue, and event
-  Interactive filters and actions designed around an analyst workflow

## 1. Why this Dashboard

The primary goal of this dashboard is to give an end-user (revenue, pricing, or partnerships analyst) a fast way to **value the resale market** without having to write a single query in my database. Instead of static and tabular data, the dashboard centers around the following questions:

-  How big is each category's market in terms of week-long sales and event volume?
-  Which venues within a state are driving the bulk of that value? 
-  Which mid-level venues are potential targets for a specific industry partnership?
-  Which specific events are worth deeper promotional budgets?

By anchoring my statistics to week-long totals, the dashboard stays close to real-time decision making, aligning with (what I think is) a realistic historical analysis of momentum.

### 1.1 End Users

When building this dashboard, I wanted to keep in mind the end user and business case. If I were to throw many unaligned statistics in a fancy dashboard, it might look good on a portfolio, but it would lose its charm because of its overcomplexity and lack of targeted insight. Here, an analyst on a pricing, inventory, or strategy team can scan multiple markets quickly.

I wanted to add interactions as well so that a user can move from a wide state-level view down to a single event in just a few clicks. Likewise, a main focus was to lean into my NLP categorization of events to show the makeup of a market.

### 1.2 The Specific Use Cases

I had the opportunity in the Fall to talk to a previous intern at Oak View Group who worked in Partnerships. From the conversation, I learned that dashboards like this are often the starting point for evaluating whether a market is attractive enough to justify a new deal.

If a venue came to OVG and wanted to partner with a new company as its primary jeweler, the partnerships team would first want to understand how strong that venue's event mix and demand really are. 

A view like this makes it easy to (1) quantify resale volume for that venue within (and relative to) its state, (2) see how much that volume comes from concerts vs sports or theater, and (3) identify mid-tier venues where a sponsor could still stand out.

The same logic applies on the promoter or rights-holder side. A touring team can quickly see which cities and venues outperform the others on resale, while a pricing team can spot events whose resale performance is out of sync with primary expectations and might deserve a price change or extra marketing.

## 2. Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is organized to highlight a few specific patterns that matter for resale (and primary) market valuation:

-  **Category-specific market size**
   The 7-day sales and event count bars by category show which segments actually drive revenue vs those that mostly add inventory. This is helpful when deciding where to focus pricing experiments or partnership conversations.
   
-  **Venue performance within a state or city**
-  **Price and volume dynamics**
-  **Event-level drilldowns**

## 3. Design Choices and Interactions

The dashboard is quite simple on the surface. However, I wanted to experiment with Tableau and add some design features that enhance its usability.

-  **7-day rolling windows**
-  **Linked actions instead of only filters**
-  **Consistent formatting for categories**

## 4. Connecting back to the SeatData.io pipeline

This Tableau layer sits on top of the warehouse, feature engineering, and modeling parts of this overarching project. The categories seen in the dashboard come from the regex-driven `dim_events_categorized` table and the higher-level focus buckets used in my data mart. 

The core metrics such as 7-day sales totals, event counts, and average listing prices are pulled from the data mart as well. Because the upstream data is structured in a star schema, building slices by state, venue, and category in Tableau was mostly a matter of selecting dimensions rather than cleaning data from scratch.

Going forward, this same dashboard structure can be extended with time-series paneling, features like revenue per slice with finer and complete historical data, or overlays from primary ticketing sources for comparison. Likewise, you could even integrate modeling predictions from a data science team to visually forecast high-demand events that must get that marketing push.

Hope you enjoy, and feel free to play around with the data below!
