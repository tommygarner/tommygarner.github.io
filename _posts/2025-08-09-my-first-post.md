# Welcome to my blog!

This is my very first blog post. I'm excited to start writing about my projects and what I'm learning.

In this post, I want to talk about how I set up my website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I plan to use this blog to share my progress.

I'm learning about creating repositories to host my projects, domains and subdomains via folders, and markdown syntax within Github.

Stay tuned for more posts about my projects, programming, and other things I find interesting!
