title: "Scoring the DGPT"
---

## Introduction
I love playing and watching disc golf. I could tell you what the easiest course is in my hometown, or even the easiest hole I know. However, that's based purely on my bias and little playing experience of less than 3 years. 

In my 3 years of playing, I've brought along friends and had some of the deepest conversations on the course. I've made incredible shots on video and have used UDisc as my Strava equivalent. Eventually, as everyone does, I came across Jomez.

[JomezPro]([url](https://www.youtube.com/@JomezPro)) is a disc golf media channel that captures a large majority of content on the Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT). The channel features lead cards from every round while also incorporating highlight plays from the Chase cards and other players in competition.

I love JomezPro. The content is pure. Scorecards are clean. Video editing is sharp. And the BigSexyCommentary can always make me chuckle.

Over time, my love for disc golf has grown, culminating in going to my first ever pro event at the 2024 MVP Open at Austin, where Niklas Anttila won his second-straight tournament in Austin at the Harvey Penick course. 

As I've watched more and more of the 2025 pro tour this year, I've wondered what the hardest course is. You know, the one that the pros dread to visit. Or the hardest holes that give you the heart-breaking triple bogeys. Or what the easiest 'gimmie' hole is, that would be total embarrassment to miss the bird.

## Methodology
To answer these questions, I chose to turn to the raw data.

How can we use analytics to determine the difficulty of a course or a specific hole? What determines difficulty? Is it subjective, or can it be solved using analytics?

To answer these questions, I determined that performance will be a relative proxy for determining difficulty of a course, especially for intangibles such as subjective feel or even accounting for OBs, Mandatories (mandos), and Hazards.

Specifically, StatMando tracks an 'Avg to Par' metric that calculates the average score during the tournament relative to the par for a given hole. Think of this as net rating in basketball.

### Data Collection
This website [Statmando]([url](https://statmando.com/stats/tour-holes-2024-mpo)) is a platform that provides granular disc golf statistics on every pro and many amateur events and tournaments. The company was found by a group of disc golfers who wanted to create a resource where statistics live for the niche sport, and their data helps rank, profile, and compare statistics amongst players and performances. 

The table this project drew inspiration from is from the Statmando's StatZone, a specific page on the site that contains data on individual holes from Major and Elite series events in the 2024 MPO division. This would classify as hole-by-hole data, including data analysis metrics like Avg to Par, under and over Par percentages.

## Top 5 Hardest Holes

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discraft Ledgestone Open | Northwood Black | 12 | 5 | 1050 | 1.41 | 281 | 2023 |
| Discraft Ledgestone Open | Northwood Black | 12 | 5 | 1050 | 1.34 | 324 | 2021 |
| Discraft Ledgestone Open | Northwood Black | 14 | 5 | 893 | 1.31 | 324 | 2021 |

**#1 Discraft Ledgestone Open - Northwood Black - Hole 12**

Par 5, 1,050ft at *1.41 Avg to Par*

This hole looks like it sucks. A wooded tee shot that needs to get ~400ft down the fairway for even a chance at par. A narrow upshot over a low water crossing that has a generous landing zone. And the final approach into another technical wooded area. And to top it all off, a lowered basket. 

In the 2023 Discraft Ledgestone Open, this hole claimed its most victims. Only 3 people birdied (or better, but will be a miracle if we ever see it) on this hole. That's about 1%. In contrast, 74% of the field bogeyed or worse, and 25% of players managed to get par. 

Funny enough, this hole also takes the 2nd and 4th places in the most difficult holes seen on the DGPT since 2021. If it wasn't for a course change in 2024, I'd have no doubt this hole would've taken 4 of the top 5 spots, and the course maybe all 5 spots, on this list.

## Top 5 Easiest Holes

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Las Vegas Challenge | Innova Discs | 16 | 5 | 888 | -0.86 | 194 | 2021 |

**#1 Las Vegas Challenge - Innova Discs - Hole 12**

Par 5, 888ft at *-0.86 Avg to Par*

Now for the easiest course on the whole tour: The Innova Discs Course during the 2021 Las Vegas Challenge. 

Minus an initial handful of trees along the teepad, once you escape, there is nothing stopping players from ripping the disc any way they'd like. Heizer or Anny. The fairway is wide open except for a small pond to the right. However, the 2021 pin position was pushed back into a safe green. So players could have a lot of fun with this hole.

Relative to par, the 2021 Las Vegas Challenge saw almost every player receive a birdie, where everyone at least at a great look. Only 6% of players bogeyed or worse on this hole, while 17% received a par of 5, and 77% of players received a birdie or better.

This hole is unique because, after 2021 adjustments, the course decided to revert its changes and par score, likely because of the dramatic scores seen across the field. Therefore, 2022 and 2023 metrics show that this hole was reduced back to a par 4 along with some pin and tee changes with more water in play.

**#1 Northwood Black, Morton, IL**

Shocker. With 4 of the top 5 hardest holes on the entire DGPT in the past 4 years, this course is a gauntlet. Wooded. Technical. Long. Unforgiving. Illinois. The whole 9 yards.

To think that players will typically score, on average, 0.25 points higher than par on a given round at Northwood Black is pretty insane. Granted, watching JomezPro has inadvertedly caused me to expect negative scores from any professional on any course. However, the only followed cards are your lead cards, which are shooting sometimes 10-down per round. 

To put the whole field into perspective, the average-to-par across the 4 year span is -0.06, meaning that, on average, any given player on the DGPT, playing any course during any year, will shoot 0.06 points less than par. But for Northwood Black to have almost +0.10 points on average on the second-hardest course is a significant ocurrence. 

## Top Easiest Courses

| Event | Layout | Avg to Par |
|---|---|---|
| PDGA Champions Cup | WR Jackson Memorial Course | -0.195278 |
| Las Vegas Challenge | Innova Discs | -0.194630 |
| Green Mountain Championship | Brewster Ridge | -0.188519 |
| Las Vegas Challenge | Infinite Discs | -0.181389 |
| The Preserve Championship | Black Bear | -0.177222 |

**#1 W.R. Jackson Memorial Course, Appling, GA**

The W.R. Jackson Memorial Course is an interesting case because many consider the course a "championship-level wooded course". However, in 2022, the course had an average-to-par score of -0.22, and in 2023, the field scored -0.17 less than par for the course. 

In fact, upon researching this topic, many consider The Preserve Championship being the easiest course on the DGPT. By breaking down scores by year, however, the Black Bear layout received a -0.17 'Avg to Par' score in 2021, -0.13 in 2022, -0.29 in 2023, and -0.18 in 2024.

This is largely due to the amount of times each course has been played. The Black Bear layout has been played more than 2x as much as the W.R. Jackson Memorial Course. Therefore, with more opportunities to play in the future, we will be able to see the average-to-par statistics converge to their true means, possibly revealing the fans' intution of Black Bear being the easiest course statistically on the DGPT.

## Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed my ramble about disc golf, and I hope I've convinced you to try out a JomezPro video next time you're searching YouTube for a video to watch while you eat your food!
