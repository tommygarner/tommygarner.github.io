title: "Scoring the DGPT"
---

## Introduction
I love playing and watching disc golf. I could tell you what the easiest course is in my hometown, or even the easiest hole I know. However, that's based purely on my bias and little playing experience of less than 3 years. 

In my 3 years of playing, I've brought along friends and had some of the deepest conversations on the course. I've made incredible shots on video and have used UDisc as my Strava equivalent. Eventually, as everyone does, I came across Jomez.

[JomezPro]([url](https://www.youtube.com/@JomezPro)) is a disc golf media channel that captures a large majority of content on the Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT). The channel features lead cards from every round while also incorporating highlight plays from the Chase cards and other players in competition.

I love JomezPro. The content is pure. Scorecards are clean. Video editing is sharp. And the BigSexyCommentary can always make me chuckle.

Over time, my love for disc golf has grown, culminating in going to my first ever pro event at the 2024 MVP Open at Austin, where Niklas Anttila won his second-straight tournament in Austin at the Harvey Penick course. 

As I've watched more and more of the 2025 pro tour this year, I've wondered what the hardest course is. You know, the one that the pros dread to visit. Or the hardest holes that give you the heart-breaking triple bogeys. Or what the easiest 'gimmie' hole is, that would be total embarrassment to miss the bird.

## Methodology
To answer these questions, I chose to turn to the raw data.

How can we use analytics to determine the difficulty of a course or a specific hole? What determines difficulty? Is it subjective, or can it be solved using analytics?

To answer these questions, I determined that performance will be a relative proxy for determining difficulty of a course, especially for intangibles such as subjective feel or even accounting for OBs, Mandatories (mandos), and Hazards.

Specifically, StatMando tracks an 'Avg to Par' metric that calculates the average score during the tournament relative to the par for a given hole. Think of this as net rating in basketball.

### Data Collection
This website [Statmando]([url](https://statmando.com/stats/tour-holes-2024-mpo)) is a platform that provides granular disc golf statistics on every pro and many amateur events and tournaments. The company was found by a group of disc golfers who wanted to create a resource where statistics live for the niche sport, and their data helps rank, profile, and compare statistics amongst players and performances. 

The table this project drew inspiration from is from the Statmando's StatZone, a specific page on the site that contains data on individual holes from Major and Elite series events in the 2024 MPO division. This would classify as hole-by-hole data, including data analysis metrics like Avg to Par, under and over Par percentages.

## Top 5 Hardest Holes
| Event | Layout | Hole # | Hole Par | Length | Avg to Par | Times Played | Year |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discraft Ledgestone Open | Black Long | 12* | 5 | 1050 | 1.41 | 281 | 2023 |
| Discraft Ledgestone Open | Black | 14 | 5 | 893 | 1.31 | 324 | 2021 |
| PDGA Professional Disc Golf World Championships | New London Worlds MPO | 6 | 5 | 1215 | 1.18 | 411 | 2024 |
| PCS Open | PCS Open 2023 MPO | 12 | 4 | 696 | 1.11 | 297 | 2023 |
| PDGA Champions Cup | MPO 2024 Champs Cup | 12 | 5 | 1050 | 0.95 | 285 | 2024 |

**Hole 12 at the Northwood Black course was also the 2nd and 4th hardest hole by oP% in the 2021 AND 2022 Discraft Ledgestone Open. For the sake of unique holes, we will omit the duplicate record, but this definitely factors into decisionmaking*

**#1 Discraft Ledgestone Open - Black - Hole 14**

Par 5, 893ft at *79.01% over Par*

This hole features a tee-shot through a highly-technical and wooded straight. However, that's only the beginning, because the dogleg left is nearly a 90-degree turn with littered trees throughout the fairway. Essentially, getting any kick left or right off the tee-shot is an instant nightmare.

In the 2021 Discraft Ledgestone Open, 79.01% of players shot over 5 on this hole. 18.83% of players shot 5. And 2.16% of players actually birdied this hole. So you're saying there's a chance!
