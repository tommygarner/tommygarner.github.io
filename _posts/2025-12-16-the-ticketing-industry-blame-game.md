## Introduction
While hanging out in the dentist lobby before my checkup, I came across a Business Insider post that caught my attention: [*"Why Concert Tickets are so Expensive -- and Who's to Blame"*](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-concert-tickets-are-so-expensive-and-whos-to-blame-2025-12). 

The popular narrative typically points the finger at ticketing platforms for high prices and other inconveniences when purchasing online. However, as I researched the industry's market structure, it became clear that the reality is complex and involves incentives where every artist, promoter, venue, and reseller is acting rationally within a faulty system.

## Stakeholder Incentives

To understand the surge in prices, we have to look at what drives revenue for each player in the industry.

### 1. The Artists
The BI video notes how, up until the 2000s, tours promoted albums. Now, albums promote tours. Where artists received majority of their revenue from physical copies of their music, they now only receive fractions of pennies per stream. Live events have inherently become the primary income source for musicians[^1].

Artists must balance maximizing gross revenue per show to support their production costs with maintaining a "fan-friendly" brand. This becomes interesting when you discover that it is the artists who actually set the price of their concerts while publicly blaming platforms for the high prices that their own guarantees require.

### 2. The Promoters

### 3. The Venues

### 4. Primary Sellers

### 5. Secondary Sellers

### 6. The Fans

## Where the Current Structure Falls Short
The reason for this market disconnect isn't because prices are high, but that the ticketing industry lacks transparency and trust. 

### 1. The "Junk Fee" Act
For decades, both primary and secondary platforms hid a variety of fees from fans until the final checkout screen, where prices would increase anywhere from %XX-%XX on top of face value.

The FTC's 2025 "Junk Fee" Rule now mandates "all-in pricing," requiring platforms to display this total cost upfront to consumers. While this solves the sticker shock, it doesn't lower the price. This legislation just makes the high price visible sooner, helping fans make better decisions and increasing transparency.

### 2. The BOTS Act
The Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act was originally passed in 2016 to ban the use of software to bypass security measures on ticketing platforms. However, enforcement has been challenging and ambiguously defined. 

A 2025 Executive Order directed the FTC to ramp up BOTS Act enforcement, but scalpers still have found ways around detection such as using residential proxies and "aged" accounts that can mimic human behavior. 

Classification still has much ground to cover in this area, as "Verified Fan" programs attempt to gate access. Yet, even these systems produce false positives (blocking real fans) and false negatives (letting brokers or bots in). You can imagine what these verification steps, and sometimes faults, produce in a fanbase when it comes to trust.

### 3. Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing is essentially changing ticket prices in real-time as a response to demand, inventory, or other factors. This comes from a rational line of thought: capturing revenue for the artist that would otherwise go to scalpers. However, the execution has proven difficult to convince consumers of pure intentions.

When a fan enters a queue seeing $150 and reaches checkout to find the same seat is now worth double, it feels much like a bait-and-switch. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has already pushed for "pressure selling" rules. These would require ticketing platforms to provide a 24-hour noteice of dynamic pricing tiers to potential buyers, for example.
