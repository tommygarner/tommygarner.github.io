## Introduction
While hanging out in the dentist lobby before my checkup, I came across a Business Insider post that caught my attention: [*"Why Concert Tickets are so Expensive -- and Who's to Blame"*](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-concert-tickets-are-so-expensive-and-whos-to-blame-2025-12). 

The popular narrative typically points the finger at ticketing platforms for high prices and other inconveniences when purchasing online. However, as I researched the industry's market structure, it became clear that the reality is complex and involves incentives where every artist, promoter, venue, and reseller is acting rationally within a faulty system.

## Stakeholder Incentives

To understand the surge in prices, we ahve to look at what drives revenue for each player in the industry.

### 1. The Artists
The BI video notes how, up until the 2000s, tours promoted albums. Now, albums promote tours. Where artists received majority of their revenue from physical copies of their music, they now only receive fractions of pennies per stream. Live events have inherently become the primary income source for musicians[^1].

Artists must balance maximizing gross revenue per show to support their production costs with maintaining a "fan-friendly" brand. This becomes interesting when you discover that it is the artists who actually set the price of their concerts while publicly blaming platforms for the high prices that their own guarantees require.

### 2. The Promoter
