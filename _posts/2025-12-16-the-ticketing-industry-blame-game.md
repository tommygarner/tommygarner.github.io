## Introduction
While hanging out in the dentist lobby before my checkup, I came across a Business Insider post that caught my attention: [*"Why Concert Tickets are so Expensive -- and Who's to Blame"*](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-concert-tickets-are-so-expensive-and-whos-to-blame-2025-12). This video gives a high-level overview of the tension between fans, artists, promoters, and ticketing platforms. 

As I prepare for recruitment in the spring, I thought this would be a great opportunity to write about the market structure of the ticketing industry to both learn myself and communicate how we ended up where we are.

## Where we are currently
The BI video report provided a tense, almost circular blame-game between fans, artists, and primary and secondary sellers.

Fans are frustrated because the average ticket price has skyrocketed from XXX in 20XX to XXX in 2025. Artists share in their fans' frustration because it's harder than every to get a ticket to a show, and call out Ticketmaster and Live Nation, as well as other ticketing platforms. Ticketmaster and Live Nation defer to the seconary market, where they cite the real inflation happens, while resale platforms blame Ticketmaster for their ticketing contracts and control over many aspects of the live entertainment industry, preventing any competition.
