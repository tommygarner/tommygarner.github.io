## Introduction
While waiting in the dentist lobby before my checkup, I came across a Business Insider post that caught my attention: [*"Why Concert Tickets are so Expensive -- and Who's to Blame"*](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-concert-tickets-are-so-expensive-and-whos-to-blame-2025-12). 

The popular narrative typically points the finger at ticketing platforms for high prices and other inconveniences when purchasing online. However, as I researched the industry's market structure, it became clear that the reality is complex and involves incentives where every artist, promoter, venue, and reseller is acting rationally within a faulty system.

## Stakeholder Incentives

To understand the surge in prices, we have to look at what drives revenue for each player in the industry.

### 1. The Artists
The BI video notes how, up until the 2000s, tours promoted albums. Now, albums promote tours. Where artists received majority of their revenue from physical copies of their music, they now only receive fractions of pennies per stream. Live events have inherently become the primary income source for musicians[^1].

Artists must balance maximizing gross revenue per show to support their production costs with maintaining a "fan-friendly" brand. This becomes interesting when you discover that it is the artists who actually set the price of their concerts while publicly blaming platforms for the high prices that their own guarantees require.

### 2. The Promoters
Concert promoters, such as Live Nation or AEG, take on the financial risk of putting on a show. They will negotiate with the artist, rent the venue, handle marketing and promotions, and cover production costs, all before a show even goes on sale. 

Common deal structures would include:
-  **Flat Guarantee:** The artist receives a fixed fee regardless of ticket sales
-  **Guarantee Plus Percentage:** The artists gets a base guarantee plus a split of *net profits* after expenses are couped
-  **Versus Deal:** The artist receives the greater between the guaranteee or a percentage of *gross* ticket revenue

A 2024 analysis by Dan Wall, Live Nation's EVP of Corporate and Regulatory Affairs, highlights the thin margins in this model. Wall explains that for most major concerts, roughly 90% to 95% of the ticket's face value goes to the artist, leaving the promoter with a single-digit percentage to cover all their costs and generate a profit[^2].

This reality pushes the cost burden elsewhere. Since the ticket prices flows to the talent, the actual costs of running the show must be covered by service fees and other revenue streams like parking or F&B. These fees are typically set by and shared with the venue, but promoters do see some share of these revenues too.

### 3. The Venues
Venues have massive operating costs such as staff, security, utilities, maintenance, and insurance. So, for major arenas, nighly rental costs can be anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000. To offset these expenses, venues will rely on those other revenue streams like parking and F&B, but even moreso, venues receive a large share of the service charges fans find at checkout.

This [Philip Svensson article](https://quartr.com/insights/edge/master-of-tickets-breaking-down-live-nation-entertainment) goes into great depth on the live entertainment industry and is a highly recommended read, as he also breaks down the history of the music industry and landmark moments that led to Live Nation Entertainment. In the article, Svensson explains how the service charge is distributed per ticket, where "roughly two-thirds accrues to the venue, while the ticket company gets approximately one-fourth of the fee[^3]." 

So, it's important to understand that the fees and prices someone sees at checkout aren't all set by Ticketmaster or any other ticketing platform. Ticketmaster simply provides the infrastructure for selling and distribution of this digital inventory. Yes, Ticketmaster can recommend prices to artist management and does receive marginal profit from service charges, but the primary seller has no decision-making in setting these prices.

### 4. Primary Sellers
Industry Research confirms that Ticketmaster's acutal cut per ticket is a ballpark 5-7% of the total transaction, and an actual profit margin of 2% per ticket[^4]. The next question, then, is "How does Ticketmaster make money?" These primary sellers like AXS, Ticketmaster, and SeatGeek, operate under exclusive contracts with venues that dictate fee strcutures.

How do exclusive contracts work? When a venue needs a ticketing system, companies bid for the rights. Ticketmaster often wins these bids due to a combination of its technology and capital. Ticketmaster then frequently pays venues millions of dollars in upfront advances against future fees [^2]. In exchange for an exclusive 3-15 year contract, the venue keeps a large portion of the service fee as a rebate. 

It's important to note the ongoing antitrust argument against Ticketmaster. The DOJ's 2024 lawsuit alleges that these contracts handcuff venues in a way that prevents competitors from signing similar deals [^5]. Because Live Nation controls so many major tours, venues also fear that if they switch to a competing ticketing platform, they might lose access to lucrative Live Nation shows [^6]. 

### 5. Secondary Sellers
The secondary ticket market exists to bridge the gap between supply and demand (your StubHub, Vivid Seats, and SeatGeek resale marketplace platforms). When primary tickets are priced below market value, brokers and bots have historically stepped in to buy in bulk and resell at a markup.

While researching the resale market, I found some numbers that put into perspective how much capital is in the ticketing industry and this secondary market alone:
- The global secondary ticket market was valued at $3.18 billion in 2024 and is forecasted to grow to $8.08 billion by 2034 [^7]
- Average resale markups can be anywhere from 27.76% (StubHub) to 37.66% (SeatGeek), not to mention fees layered on top of the often inflated ticket price [^8]
- Some examples of bot-driven scalping's scale came when O2 blocked over 50,000 ticket bots in six weeks or when one ticket broker was able to get 30,000 "Hamilton" tickets in 2015-2016 [^9].

While considerable resale is fan-to-fan, the bulk of secondary inventory is acquired by these automated bots that circumvent purchase limits and verification systems. In Live Nation's 2024 Annual Report, they claim that these tickets are then flipped at markups of 200-500% or more [^9]!

### 6. The Fans
Fans sit at the receiving end of this complex structure, where they experience sticker shock from hidden fees, volatility in dynamic pricing, and competition against bots when trying to buy tickets to their favorite artist coming into town.

The disconnect is less about the absolute price (since supply and demand will always push prices up for major tours) and more about lack of transparency and fairness in how tickets are distributed and priced.

## Where the Current Structure Falls Short
The reason for this market disconnect isn't because prices are high, but that the ticketing industry lacks transparency and trust. 

### 1. The "Junk Fee" Act
For decades, both primary and secondary platforms hid a variety of fees from fans until the final checkout screen, where prices would increase anywhere from %XX-%XX on top of face value.

The FTC's "Junk Fee" Rule now mandates "all-in pricing," requiring platforms to display this total cost upfront to consumers. While this solves the sticker shock, it doesn't lower the price. This legislation just makes the high price visible sooner, helping fans make better decisions and increasing transparency. This legislation is effective May 12, 2025.[^10]

### 2. The BOTS Act
The Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act was originally passed in 2016 to ban the use of software to bypass security measures on ticketing platforms. However, enforcement has been challenging and ambiguously defined. 

An Executive Order signed on March 31, 2025 directed the FTC to ramp up BOTS Act enforcement, but scalpers still have found ways around detection such as using residential proxies and "aged" accounts that can mimic human behavior. 

Classification still has much ground to cover in this area, as "Verified Fan" programs attempt to gate access. Yet, even these systems produce false positives (blocking real fans) and false negatives (letting brokers or bots in). You can imagine what these verification steps, and sometimes faults, produce in a fanbase when it comes to trust.[^11]

### 3. Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing is essentially changing ticket prices in real-time as a response to demand, inventory, or other factors. This comes from a rational line of thought: capturing revenue for the artist that would otherwise go to scalpers. However, the execution has proven difficult to convince consumers of pure intentions.

When a fan enters a queue seeing $150 and reaches checkout to find the same seat is now worth double, it feels much like a bait-and-switch. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has already pushed for "pressure selling" rules[^12]. These would require ticketing platforms to provide a 24-hour notice of dynamic pricing tiers to potential buyers, for example. 

## Solutions
Data guy, data decisions
* Cap resale price at primary price
* Better demand forecasting
* ...any other?
