This project uses Statmando’s detailed hole‑level statistics to measure course and hole difficulty across the Disc Golf Pro Tour. The analysis aggregates multi‑year data, standardizes layouts, and uses average‑to‑par as a performance‑based proxy for difficulty, surfacing the most punishing and most forgiving holes and courses on tour.

The full blog post and visualizations walk through the data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, and storytelling around what makes certain layouts so brutal and others scoring festivals.
