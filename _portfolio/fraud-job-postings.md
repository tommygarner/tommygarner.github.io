This project tackles the challenge of detecting fraudulent job postings by combining classic feature engineering with modern machine learning. The pipeline cleans and vectorizes job descriptions, engineers metadata features (e.g., company information, salary anomalies, location patterns), and trains tree‑based and linear models to predict whether a posting is legitimate or suspicious.

Model performance is evaluated with precision–recall–oriented metrics to reflect the cost of false positives and false negatives, and interpretation tools are used to highlight which words and attributes push a listing toward the “fraud” label.
