The Setlist is a personalized concert recommendation app that connects listeners’ Spotify libraries with real‑time concert data. The app pulls a user’s favorite artists from Spotify, enriches them with metadata, and then queries Ticketmaster and SeatGeek APIs to find matching shows in selected markets.

Users can swipe through suggested artists in a Tinder‑style interface, save favorites, and explore upcoming events tailored to their taste. The app is built in Python with Streamlit for the UI and deployed as an interactive web app, tying together API integration, recommendation logic, and a smooth fan‑facing experience.
