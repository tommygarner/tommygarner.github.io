This project explores how to recommend albums rather than individual tracks, focusing on helping listeners discover full projects they are likely to enjoy from end to end. The system combines audio features and metadata from streaming APIs with user listening patterns to learn which albums tend to resonate together and which signals best capture “vibe” and context.

The workflow covers data ingestion and cleaning, feature engineering at the album level, and model experimentation with both collaborative and content‑based approaches. Evaluation focuses on playlist‑style recommendation quality and cold‑start performance for newer releases, with an eye toward realistic product use cases like “if you loved this album, queue up these next three.”
