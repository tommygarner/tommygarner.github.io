Scoring the DGPT: The Toughest and Easiest Holes and courses of the 2024 MPO Season
Analyzing the Hardest and Easiest Holes and Courses on the 2024 DGPT MPO Tour

This is where you'll introduce your project. Briefly explain your goal: to determine the toughest and easiest holes and courses on the 2024 Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT) for the Men's Pro Open (MPO) division. Mention what data you used (e.g., scoring data from DGPT events).

Methodology
In this section, you'll provide a high-level overview of your process. You can use bullet points to make it easy to follow.

Data Source: State where you got your data.

Data Preparation: Explain any cleaning or preprocessing steps you took. For example, did you handle missing values or calculate new metrics?

Analysis: Describe how you determined "hardest" and "easiest." For example, you might mention using metrics like strokes over par or birdie percentages.

Key Findings
This is the most important part of your blog post. Present your results and what you found. You can use headings to organize your findings.

Hardest Holes
List the top 3-5 hardest holes you identified. For each one, you could include:

The course and hole number.

The key metric (e.g., average strokes over par).

A brief explanation of why you think the hole is so difficult (e.g., water hazards, tight fairways).

Easiest Holes
Do the same for the easiest holes.

List the top 3-5 easiest holes.

Provide the key metric.

Offer a brief explanation of why the hole is easier (e.g., short, open, birdie opportunities).

Hardest and Easiest Courses
Summarize your findings for the overall courses.

List the hardest course and its average score.

List the easiest course and its average score.

Conclusion
Wrap up your blog post with a summary of your findings and any interesting insights you gained. You could also mention potential next steps or limitations of your analysis.

Full Code and Data
Finally, include a link to your full Jupyter Notebook so readers can see all the code. Since you're uploading the notebook to the same repository, you can simply link to the file. For example:
