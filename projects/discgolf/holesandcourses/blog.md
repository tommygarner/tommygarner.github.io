# Scoring the DGPT

## Introduction
I love playing and watching disc golf, and there's a large community of casuals, amateurs and pros that debate what is the toughest course or hole alive. This project was motivated by that debate, trying to determine both the toughest and easiest holes and courses on the 2024 Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT) for the Men's Pro Open (MPO) division.

## Methodology
Explain your process step-by-step. Use headings to break up different stages of your work.

### Data Collection
Describe where you got your data and how you collected it.

```python
# Code used for data collection
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
