Tommy Garner is a data scientist and MS Business Analytics student at The University of Texas at Austin. He is interested in applying analytics and machine learning to the media and live entertainment industries, with projects spanning fraud job detection, ticket demand forecasting, and music recommendation systems.

This site highlights a mix of academic and personal work, including end‑to‑end pipelines for fraud detection, time series models for event demand, and recommendation engines. Each project page includes code, visualizations, and discussion of modeling choices, evaluation, and how the results can support real‑world decisions for concert‑goers, sports fans, and streaming audiences.

Outside of analytics, Tommy enjoys playing and watching basketball, disc golf, and guitar, and his faith motivates him to pursue impact and service that extend well beyond himself.
