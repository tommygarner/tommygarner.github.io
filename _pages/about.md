Hi, I'm Tommy Garner!

I'm a current Masters of Science in Business Analytics student at The University of Texas at Austin. I am getting quite excited about working with data to solve problems, and excited to showcase it here. Specifically, I want to build models, visualizations, and algorithms that make the live entertainment industry a little smarter and a lot more fun!

Most of my projects live at the intersection between music, sports, and media (if my professors allow it!) and I've enjoyed building an album recommendation system, a concert discovery app, and modeling for ticket demand forecasting. I've also worked on exploratory data analysis projects and end-to-end projects that help me improve my storytelling with the help of data, such as a fraudulent job posting detection application. Also, I help volunteer with SIL Global, a faith-based NP langugage development organization, as a Data and Business Analyst.

I'm a huge San Antonio Spurs fan, disc-golfer, and guitar player. Much of my time in Austin has been spent going to impromptu concerts with my friends and plugging into my church.
