# Tommy Garner

I'm a graduate student in the **MS Business Analytics** program at UT Austin, passionate about solving complex problems through machine learning, data science, and full-stack development. I am building end-to-end data applications like exploring web scraping and feature engineering to model deployment and interactive dashboards.

## Featured Projects

### [Scoring the DGPT](https://tommygarner.github.io/2025/08/24/scoring-the-dgpt.html)
What is the hardest course on the Disc Golf Pro Tour? I tackled this question analytically using statistical modeling to quantify course difficulty across tournaments.

### [Album Recommendation System](https://tommygarner.github.io/2025/09/26/recommender-system.html)
Built a music album recommender by web scraping crowdsourced reviews and developing custom word embeddings to capture nuanced listening preferences.

### [Job Posting Fraud Detection](https://github.com/tommygarner/job-postings-fraud)
Developed a classification system using MiniBERT and missingness-based feature engineering to identify fraudulent job listings, with SHAP/LIME interpretability analysis.

### [The Setlist](https://github.com/tommygarner/setlist)
Built a personalized concert recommendation app that matches your music taste with upcoming shows. Features include Tinder-style artist swiping, Spotify integration for auto-syncing favorites, and real-time concert data from Ticketmaster and SeatGeek APIs. Deployed with Streamlit and Python.

## About Me

I'm a graduate student in **Business Analytics at UT Austin** learning to apply the machine learning, full-stack development, and creative problem-solving in my classes. I love projects that combine the technical side of my studies and my interests in music and sports. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at concerts exploring live music, playing guitar myself, or playing basketball with good friends.

## Skills & Tools

**Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
**ML & Analytics:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, LSTM/MLP, SHAP/LIME, Time Series (ARIMA/Fable)  
**Data Stack:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Pandas, bigrquery  
**Development:** Streamlit, GitHub, Google Colab, Supabase, API integration
