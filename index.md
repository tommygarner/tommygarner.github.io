# Hi, I'm Tommy Garner!

I love to solve complex problems, and I'm currently trying to create a Github Pages to host these projects and blogs as I continue learning. I'm enrolled at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin's Masters of Science in Business Analytics program, so a lot of my work will feature academic projects along with passion projects as I try out new tools.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite recent projects. Each one is a detailed write-up of my work, including code, visuals, and my thoughts.

* **[Scoring the DGPT](https://tommygarner.github.io/_posts/2025-08-24-scoring-the-dgpt.md)**
    * *What is the hardest course on the Disc Golf Pro Tour? Solving the problem analytically.*
* **[Project 2 Title](URL_to_Project_2_Page)**
    * *A brief, one-sentence description of Project 2.*
* **[Test Data Analysis Project](/projects/test-data-analysis-project.html)**
    * *A brief, one-sentence description of Project 3.*
