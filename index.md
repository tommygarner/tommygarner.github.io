# Hi, I'm Tommy Garner!

I love to learn about coding and solving problems, and I'm currently trying to create a Github Pages to host these projects and blogs as I continue learning. I'm enrolled at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin's Masters of Science in Business Analytics program, so a lot of my work will feature academic projects along with passion projects as I try out new tools.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite recent projects. Each one is a detailed write-up of my work, including code, visuals, and my thoughts.

* **[Project 1 Title](URL_to_Project_1_Page)**
    * *A brief, one-sentence description of Project 1.*
* **[Project 2 Title](URL_to_Project_2_Page)**
    * *A brief, one-sentence description of Project 2.*
