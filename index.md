# Tommy Garner

I'm a graduate student in the **MS Business Analytics** program at UT Austin, passionate about solving complex problems through machine learning, data science, and full-stack development. I build end-to-end data applications—from web scraping and feature engineering to model deployment and interactive dashboards.

## Featured Projects

### [Scoring the DGPT](https://tommygarner.github.io/2025/08/24/scoring-the-dgpt.html)
What is the hardest course on the Disc Golf Pro Tour? I tackled this question analytically using statistical modeling to quantify course difficulty across tournaments.

### [Album Recommendation System](https://tommygarner.github.io/2025/09/26/recommender-system.html)
Built a music album recommender by web scraping crowdsourced reviews and developing custom word embeddings to capture nuanced listening preferences.

### [Job Posting Fraud Detection](https://github.com/tommygarner/job-postings-fraud)
Developed a classification system using MiniBERT and missingness-based feature engineering to identify fraudulent job listings, with SHAP/LIME interpretability analysis.

### [Event Ticket Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/tommygarner/setlist)
Built time-series forecasting models (ARIMA with multiple regressors) on 10,000+ live events using R, BigQuery, and Streamlit to predict concert ticket resale dynamics.

## About Me

I specialize in **machine learning** (ensemble methods, deep learning, NLP), **optimization** (Gurobi, scipy), and **full-stack development** (Python, SQL, Streamlit, Supabase, APIs). My work spans fraud detection, time-series forecasting, sentiment analysis, and building interactive data applications [memory:1][memory:6][memory:14].

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at concerts exploring live music, at the gym, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen [memory:1].

## Skills & Tools

**Languages:** Python, R, SQL, JavaScript  
**ML & Analytics:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, LSTM/MLP, SHAP/LIME, Time Series (ARIMA/Fable)  
**Data Stack:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Pandas, bigrquery  
**Development:** Streamlit, GitHub, Google Colab, VS Code, Supabase, API integration
